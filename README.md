# androidapp

It is my first android app. It uses Java, SQLite and XML. The IDE is Android Studio.

This app allows admin to buy raffle tickets for the users and pick a "lucky draw" among the buyers. It also provides image upload, msg sharing functions for better user experience. Dont' forget upload one image to the folder under the simulator's folder if testing the image uploading.

More functions include

listing all the tickets for one raffle
creating a new raffle
editing existing raffle or ticket
editing the address of buyer
